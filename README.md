# BINF_6110-Assign1
## Introduction

Whole-genome assembly and reference-based genome comparison are fundamental tasks in bioinformatics and are widely applied in microbial genomics, pathogen surveillance, and evolutionary studies (Quainoo et al., 2017). The goal of this assignment is to assemble a consensus genome of *Salmonella enterica* from raw Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads and to compare the assembled genome to a reference genome obtained from NCBI through alignment and variant analysis.

*Salmonella enterica* is a bacterial pathogen of major public health importance and has a relatively small (approximately 5 Mb), haploid genome, making it well suited for de novo genome assembly using long-read sequencing data (Li et al., 2021). Bacterial genomes typically lack the extensive repetitive content and ploidy complexity found in many eukaryotic genomes, allowing assembly strategies to focus primarily on read length, sequencing accuracy, and coverage rather than phasing or large-scale scaffolding (Zadesenets et al., 2017).

Next-generation sequencing technologies are commonly divided into short-read and long-read platforms, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Short-read sequencing technologies, such as Illumina, produce highly accurate reads that enable precise base-level analyses but often result in fragmented assemblies due to their limited read length, particularly in repetitive genomic regions (Whiteford et al., 2005). In contrast, long-read sequencing technologies, including Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), generate reads that span several kilobases, enabling improved assembly contiguity and resolution of structural features (Kim et al., 2024). However, long-read sequencing data are generally characterized by higher per-base error rates, particularly insertions and deletions, which can affect consensus accuracy if not properly addressed (Amarasinghe et al., 2020).

Recent improvements in ONT chemistry and basecalling accuracy have made long-read-only genome assembly increasingly feasible for bacterial genomes, provided that appropriate assembly and alignment methods are used (Zhang et al., 2021). Long-read assemblers reconstruct genomes by identifying overlaps between reads to generate contiguous sequences, but sequencing errors can still lead to misassemblies or incorrect consensus sequences, highlighting a trade-off between structural completeness and base-level accuracy (Bzikadze et al., 2022).

Reference-based alignment provides a complementary approach for evaluating genome assemblies and identifying genetic differences relative to a known reference (Liu et al., 2018). Modern aligners typically use heuristic strategies, such as k-mer-based seeding followed by local alignment extension, to efficiently compare large sequences (Shaw & Yu, 2023). While these methods are computationally efficient, alignment accuracy can be influenced by sequencing errors, repetitive regions, and reference bias, which must be considered when interpreting variant calls (Freeman et al., 2020).

In this assignment, a long-read genome assembly approach is combined with reference-based alignment and visualization to compare an assembled *Salmonella enterica* genome to a reference sequence. This workflow highlights the practical trade-offs between sequencing technology, assembly strategy, and alignment-based comparison, while providing hands-on experience with commonly used bioinformatics tools.
